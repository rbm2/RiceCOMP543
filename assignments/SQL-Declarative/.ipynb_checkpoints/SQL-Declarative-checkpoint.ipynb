    "# Assignment 1 -- Declarative SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to write several SQL queries that will answer questions over the database used by the imaginary Southern Sierra Wildflower Club (SSWC), an organization whose members are interested in observing wildflowers in their native habitat in the southern part of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database maintained by the club has four tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "SIGHTINGS (SIGHT_ID, <ins>NAME</ins>, <ins>PERSON</ins>, <ins>LOCATION</ins>, <ins>SIGHTED</ins>)\n",
    "\n",
    "FEATURES (LOC\\_ID, <ins>LOCATION</ins>, CLASS, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, MAP, ELEV)\n",
    "\n",
    "FLOWERS (FLOW\\_ID, GENUS, SPECIES, <ins>COMNAME</ins>) \n",
    "\n",
    "PEOPLE (PERSON\\_ID, <ins>PERSON</ins>)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that attribute(s) that form the key for each table/relation are underlined. \n",
    "\n",
    "The database tables have the following semantics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SIGHTINGS** gives information that describes every time that a member of the club observes one of the wildflowers described in the table \n",
    "\n",
    "* **FLOWERS.NAME** tells the name of the flower observed, **PERSON** describes who saw the flower, **LOCATION** tells the name of a nearby geographical feature where the flower was seen, and **SIGHTED** tells the day when the flower was seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FEATURES** lists the various locations where flowers have been observed. **LOCATION** is the name of the place, **CLASS** is the type of place (there are several types, such as **Summit, Mine, Locale**, etc.), **LATITUDE** and **LONGITUDE** describe where on the surface of the earth the locations are found (if you are not familiar with the concepts of latitude and longitude, you might want to do a web search on them; the first is like an x-coordinate on the Earth's surface, and the second is like a y-coordinate). **MAP** tells the name of the topographic map where the feature can be found, and **ELEV** tells the height of the feature. \n",
    "* **FLOWERS** lists all of the flowers that the members of the SSWC try to find. **GENUS** and **SPECIES** give the scientific name for the flower, and **COMNAME** gives the non-scientific name (**SIGHTING.NAME** is a foreign key into **FLOWER.COMNAME**).\n",
    "* Finally, **PEOPLE** lists all of the people in the club.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to write SQL queries that answer the following questions, sorted, in general, by order of difficulty from easiest to most difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "**List all the results alphabetically, unless otherwise specified. List columns in the given order. Do NOT include extra columns or rows in the results. Do not add any extra characters or punctuation. **\n",
    "\n",
    "First, set up SQL:"
